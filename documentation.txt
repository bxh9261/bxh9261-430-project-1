What your site does and its purpose.

My site allows the user to create alignment charts 

What part of your app does the API handle?



What went right and what went wrong?


If you were to continue, what would you do to improve your app?

I have many ideas:
-customizable options for box labels, so the chart doesn't just need to be labeled with "good, neutral, evil, lawful, etc"
-more canvas customization to pretty up the downloadable image
-the ability to upload charts for others to view


How did you go above and beyond?
